1. Create an Array that has all the characters in ascii
2. The array should keep track of each count of each character
3. Use a high priority queue to create a tree so that I can assign unique
binary value to each instance of a character
4. output new file with binary values instead of characters to lessen size the
file should have a very unique type of extension.
5. Should be able to uncompress file to original form

working currently on test.cpp
